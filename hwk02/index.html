            <div class="flex__container">
                MoodSense will not only connect to the smart ring to detect users health, 
                but unlike other competitors listed above, it will combine all of the users
                health data - sleep, activity, heart rate, stress levels, etc. - 
                to identify their current mood or wellbeing and provide suggested solutions or 
                activities to promote self-improvement. For example, if a users heart rate and
                stress levels are reaching a concerning level, MoodSense will ask the user if they are
                feeling stressed, and give them a breathing exercise to help calm them down in
                the moment. Another thing other iMood will be able to address is individual
                differences in health. Since MoodSense will ask how a user is feeling, it
                will learn over time and be able to differentiate if, for example, 
                someone is always stressed or if they simply have a high resting heart rate. 
                This app will allow people to address their current emotions and find 
                solutions to them immediately, gradually improving their quality of life overall.
