                Using PPG technology, wearing this ring detects health statistics

                provided apple health integration.

                Because you can essentially determine someone&apos;s mood 
                based on these health stats, I would want to make an apple 
                watch app with a widget feature that pairs with the smart ring 
                where you can track your mood at anytime. You could also add 
                friends on the app, and see their moods, so you can help out 
                your friends if they&apos;re ever stressed or not feeling great. 
                Additionally, I would want to implement some interactions using 
                apple watch's new assistive touch feature.
